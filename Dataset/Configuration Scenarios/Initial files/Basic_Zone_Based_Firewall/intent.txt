Implement Zone Based Firewall on a router
Create 2 security zones called “LAN” and “INTERNET” on router FIREWALL.
Place the corresponding interfaces into the correct zones.
Create the correct class-map, policy-map and zone-pair so traffic from LAN to INTERNET is
allowed, including the return traffic.
Traffic from INTERNET to LAN should be blocked.
Increase security by only allowing HTTP, ICMP and HTTPS traffic from LAN to INTERNET.
Test this by using telnet from router LAN to router INTERNET, this should be blocked.
